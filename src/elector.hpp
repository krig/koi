	  Elector

	  The elector is the decision making node in the cluster. It
	  doesn't manage services, but elects and manages masterness.

	  As any node, you have to call init() once. After init() has been
	  called, start() can be called to start sending and receiving
	  packets.
	  When started, call update() repeatedly (while polling the
	  io_service passed to it) to receive and send over the network.

	  The elector keeps track of runners it has seen recently and
	  sends status updates at a steady pace to them. The most
	  important aspect of the status update is telling runners which
	  node is the master. Nodes are identified by UUIDs, unique in a
	  running cluster.

	  In a live cluster there is ever only one elector.

	  runner_info holds all the knowledge the elector has about each
	  runner. _runners is a map from endpoint -> runner_info.

	  member functions prefixed with _ are partial update functions,
	  called by update().
